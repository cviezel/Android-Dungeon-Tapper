A roguelike game for Android devices made using C# and Unity. The player moves around the screen following your first touch, and shoots shuriken in the direction that you tap with a second finger. Additionally, you can charge your shot which will increase its damage and speed. If you hold for an entire second, the shot will phase through all enemies in a straight line and kill them. There are a limited amount of these charged shots, starting at 2, which can be increased with perks.

After completing a round, 4 perks appear on the screen. You can choose which perk to get by throwing a shuriken at the perk. The perks are as follows:
1. Restore your health and charged shots to maximum
2. Increase your charged shots by 2 and gain 2 charges
3. Increase your attack speed
4. Increase your max and current health by 20
The chosen perk lasts until the game is over. If you survive a round without taking any damage, you can select 2 perks. 

Rounds get progressively harder. Each round has 10 more enemies. Also, enemies spawn more frequently and the cap for how many to be alive at once increases as well. Every 4th level is a special boss fight level.

There are 5 different enemies that are spawned randomly.
1. Melee bruisers who slowly follow the player
2. Spikeballs which move randomly and bounce off walls - their speed increases with each bounce
3. Ghosts who rapidly fly to the player's current location
4. Cowboys who shoot bullets at the player
5. Wizards who summon frost bolts from the sky

All enemies take damage from the player's shuriken, but the ranged enemies (Cowboys and Wizards) can be killed by contact with the player, whereas the other three enemies deal damage upon physical contact.

The melee enemies have a chance to drop a health pack if they are killed with shuriken. Health packs restore 10 health, but they persist between rounds, so it is a good idea to stockpile them, especially if the player is at max health.

My game uses the following music:

Megalovania - Undertale https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoqR9Bwx1Y

Lavender Town Theme - Pokemon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay9Nl0hoxaU&t=3s

All the game's artwork was (poorly) done by me in Microsoft Paint.
