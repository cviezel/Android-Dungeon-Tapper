A Roguelike game made in Unity for Android devices. The player (white circle) moves around the screen by where you hold your finger on the screen, and shoots (orange bullets) where you tap with a second finger. Additionally, you can charge your shot which will increase its damage and speed. If you hold for an entire second, the shot will phase through all enemies in a straight line and kill them. 

There are currently 3 enemy types. Slow melee enemies (red circle) follow the player's movements and do 10 damage and die upon contact with the player. Ranged enemies (blue circle) who stay away from the player and occasionally move around. These enemies periodically shoot bullets at the player (purple bullets) which do damage upon contact. Ranged enemies can be killed by bullets or having the player make contact with them (deal no melee damage to player). Lastly, there are bombers (yellow circles) who fly at the player's current location at a rapid speed and do damage upon contact, but will die in one hit.

I plan on adding drops that give the player different powerups upon killing enemies and a special boss battle that unlocks after a certain amount of stages are cleared. Additionally, if I have enough time I will change the models from different colored circles to sprites with animations to make the game look cleaner.
